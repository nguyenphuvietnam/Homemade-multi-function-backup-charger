# 🔋 Homemade Multi-function Backup Charger

This project is a **homemade multi-function backup charger** that I developed based on 18650 battery cells and basic electronic modules.
The goal of the project is to create a device that is **both learning and practical**, helping me practice my skills in circuit design, hardware assembly and energy management.

---

## 🎯 Project goals
- Reuse old 18650 batteries from laptops.
- Create a backup charger that can charge phones and small devices.
- Practice skills in **electronics – mechanics – circuit welding – battery safety**.

---

## 🛠️ Used components
- **18650 Li-ion** battery cells (3.7V – 2200~2600mAh).
- **TP4056** Li-ion battery charging module.
- **Boost Converter** (MT3608 or 5V step-up module).
- Plastic boxes are available in the market..
- Wires, switches, USB jack.
